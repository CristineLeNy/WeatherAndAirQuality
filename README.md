# WeatherAndAirQuality
By Cristine Le Ny, Matthew McBurney, Brandon Walsh

Project for Profhacks 2023

This project aims to help people to be able to detect the air quality of any space and be
able to see how the air quality changes with changes in the altitude. It could be utilized 
to check the makeup of the air in hard to get to places. It does this through combination
of sensors connected together with an Elegoo Max that can be attached to a drone.

This project measures 5 key metrics:
Dust Particles,
CO2,
Humidity,
Temperature,
Altitude

Component Overview:
Dust Sensor (Dust),
SCD30 (CO2,Humidity,Temperature),
Ultrasonic sensor (Altitude)
